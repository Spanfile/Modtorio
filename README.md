# Modtorio

Dependencies:
* libsqlite3-dev

Copy the sample config file `modtorio.toml.sample` into `modtorio.toml` before running.

For development, set your mod portal credentials into `.env` (sample in `.env.sample`).

To use the `./sample` directory for development, copy a valid Factorio Linux headless server into it (or at the very least, the server executable into `sample/bin/x64`).
