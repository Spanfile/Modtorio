# Modtorio

Dependencies:
* libsqlite3-dev

Copy the sample config file `modtorio.toml.sample` into `modtorio.toml` before running. Any values not marked with the comment `# required` are optional and can be left out for sane defaults.

For development, copy your mod portal credentials into `.env` (sample in `.env.sample`).

To use the `./sample` directory for development, copy a valid Factorio Linux headless server into it.
